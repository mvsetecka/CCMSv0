 *
 * Note:
 * Your upload script have to return some information for FlexUpload.
 *
 * If the upload was successfull just print "OK" (uppercase without quotation marks)
 * If something went wrong print a nice error message to inform the user what happened.
 *
 *
 * Important Note:
 *
 * In real-life your upload script have to be more secure than this one.
 * You have to make sure that only authorized users can upload files to your server!
 * You also should check the extension of the uploaded file to prevent bad guys to upload
 * malicious executable files (you should not accept files endig with .ph*, .cgi, .pl, ...)
 *
 *
 * Notes for migration from JavaUpload:
 *
 * The field name has changed to "Filedata" (this is the default in Flex) so you have to use
 * $_FILES['Filedata'] to access the uploaded file.
 *
 * The format of the return value also has changed. If you print something different than "OK"
 * FlexUpload assumes an error.
 * E.g. In JavaUpload you printed "success=1\r\n" if your upload succeeds and
 * "success=0\r\nSome error occurred"
 * Now you print "OK" if your upload succeeds and "Some error occured". This helps to avoid
 * parsing errors of the return value if your script raises some php warnings or errors.
